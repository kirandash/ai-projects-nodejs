## Build AI Projects with Node.js, OpenAI, LangChain, Vector DBs, HuggingFace and TypeScript

## 1. OpenAI Fundamentals

### 1.1 OpenAI Setup, Create api key and run first prompt

- docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart
- OpenAI API Key
  - https://openai.com/index/openai-api/
  - https://platform.openai.com/
- Create a node/npm project
  - `npm init -y`
  - `npm install openai`
- run a prompt
- Note: `--env-file=.env` is used to load the environment variables from the .env file

### 1.2 Typescript setup

- `npm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node`
- `npx tsc --init`

### 1.3 OpenAI and Open Source Models ex HuggingFace

- What is a model?
  - A model is a machine learning system that generates predictions based on data. It is the core of the OpenAI API.
  - The OpenAI API provides a range of models that can be used to generate text, images, and more.
- Large language models are the most popular type of model. They can generate human-like text based on a prompt.
- OpenAI Models
  - https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
  - GPT-4o
    - CONTEXT WINDOW: A context window is a window of text that the model uses to generate predictions. The context window size is the number of tokens in the window.
    - training data date: date till which the model was trained
    - price: cost per token

### 1.5 Tokens:

- https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
- Tokens are the smallest unit of text that the model can generate. The model generates text by predicting the next token in a sequence of tokens.
- Tokens can be words, punctuation, or other characters.
- The model generates tokens based on the context window, which is a window of text that the model uses to generate predictions.
- The context window size is the number of tokens in the window.
- Learn more about tokenization: https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/1?fw=pt
- the pricing depends on tokens:
  - https://openai.com/api/pricing/
- see usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- how to check tokens in playground:
  you can go to the playground at: https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat?models=gpt-4o
- to check tokens in nodejs project:
  - https://github.com/dqbd/tiktoken
  - `npm i tiktoken`
